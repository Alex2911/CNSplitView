##Overview
`CNSplitView` is an feature enhanced derivative of `NSSplitView`. It has support for sticky top or bottom toolbars for each of its subviews. You can configure these toolbars to add buttons and/or drag handles for both, the left (or up) and right (down) sided subview.

`CNSplitView` is part of the [CocoaPods project](http://cocoapods.org) ([Specs on Github](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs)).


Here is a shot of the included example application:
